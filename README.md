Dashboards can help teachers with that. They create comprehensive student reports. The reports are based on the class and test performances, attendance and behavior of the student.  By analyzing reports, teachers can find out problem areas of every student. They can guide and suggest ways to students on how to improve their performance. Thus, dashboard analytics exponentially increase student outcomes.
